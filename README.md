# About ME
I am 17 years old and I fell in love with programming at age 16. I mainly made this account because of @talonbragg, @Sidthecoder, and @PenetratingShot. I love the projects that they make. They inspire me to make things later on. I mainly want to develop ios apps but I go to The the three buds, as I call them, for tips on websites and design. Thanks for visiting this repo about me. BYE!
